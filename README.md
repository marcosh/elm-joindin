## ELM JOINDIN

A simple page for showing link to slides of Joind.in talks

#### INSTRUCTIONS

You need to create a file `Config.elm` providing the required configuration.
You could do so by creating a symbolic link from `Config.elm.dev`

To compile the ELM code to javascript, just run `elm make JoindinMain.elm` in
the main directory. This will generate a file `elm.js`.

To see the result then open `joindin.html`.
